# Pyber Analysis

## Overview:
#
Conduct an in-depth data analysis of ride-sharing data for urban, suburban and rural cities between January 01, 2019 and April 28, 2019. Create visual representation of the data and provide stakeholders with three recommendations to help improve access to ride-sharing services and affordability to underserved neighboorhoods based on the findings.

### List of requested deliverables:
- Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type:
    * Total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type.
    * Average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type.
- Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type:
    * create a multiple-line graph that shows the total fares for each week by city type.
- Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md):
    * Analysis of how to address any disparities in the ride-sharing data among the city types.
